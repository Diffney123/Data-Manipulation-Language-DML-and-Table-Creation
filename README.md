# Data-Manipulation-Language-DML-and-Table-Creation
 Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations, specifically focusing on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, and creating tables in a relational database.

 Instructions:
Part 1: Table Creation 
Choose a hypothetical scenario for a database system. It could be related to a business, educational institution, or any other context of your choice.
Identify at least three entities that need to be represented in your database. For example, if you choose a university scenario, entities could be Student, Course, and Instructor.
Define appropriate attributes for each entity. Ensure that you include primary keys and any necessary foreign keys to establish relationships between the entities.
Write SQL statements to create tables for each of the identified entities. Be mindful of data types, constraints, and relationships.

Part 2: DML Operations 
For each of the tables you created in Part 1, perform the following operations:

2.1 INSERT 
Insert at least three records into each table, ensuring that the values are realistic for your chosen scenario.
Include a mix of data types in your inserts, such as integers, strings, dates, etc.
Make sure to insert records that demonstrate the relationships between entities.

2.2 UPDATE 
Update at least two records in each table. This could involve changing names, updating dates, or modifying any other relevant information.
Include updates that affect the foreign keys to demonstrate cascading effects.

2.3 DELETE 
Delete at least one record from each table.
Ensure that you handle foreign key constraints appropriately to maintain data integrity.
